# College-Tuition-Calculator-with-GUI

The goal of this project is to have a program, which runs on the Graphical User Interface, that enrolls college students into the system and calculates the tuition amount due for students of different types. 

There are three types of college students; instate, outstate, and international.

(Full-Time students: 12 credits and above)

(Part-Time students: less than 12 credits)

1. For instate students, they can either have funds or do not have funds. (Part Time student cannot receive funds)

2. For outstate students, they can either be tri-state or non tri-state.

3. For international students, they can either be exchange students or non-exchange students.

Different scenarios have different tuition standards. The program also does some basic operations on the enrolled-student list, such as add, remove, and print.

Add: enroll a student into the student list with the information filled in all text fields.

Remove: remove a student from the student list by searching his/her first and last name.

Print: print out the entire student list.
